üé¨ INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)
============================

"Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today I'm excited to present my CS210 final project: 
'Predicting Heart Disease Risk with Machine Learning.'

Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, claiming over 650,000 lives annually 
in the US alone. What if we could use machine learning to predict heart disease risk early, 
potentially saving lives through early intervention?

That's exactly what this project accomplishes - and I'm going to show you how we built a 
complete, production-ready system that can assess heart disease risk in real-time."

SLIDE 2: PROJECT OVERVIEW
=========================
"""

print("""
üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW (45 seconds)
===============================

"This project has three main components:

1. **Machine Learning Pipeline**: We compare three different algorithms - Logistic Regression, 
   Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting - to find the best predictor.

2. **Interactive Web Application**: A user-friendly Streamlit app where anyone can input 
   their health data and get an instant risk assessment.

3. **Production API**: A Flask REST API that can be integrated into healthcare systems.

Our best model achieved 85.9% accuracy using Gradient Boosting, which means it correctly 
identifies heart disease presence about 86 out of 100 times. Let me show you how we got there."

SLIDE 3: DATASET & DATA PREPROCESSING
====================================
"""

print("""
üìä DATASET & PREPROCESSING (60 seconds)
======================================

"We used the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which contains real clinical data from 1025 patients.

**Data Cleaning Process** (show code/results):

1. **Removed irrelevant columns**: 'id' and 'dataset' - these don't help predict heart disease

2. **Target conversion**: The original 'num' field had values 0-4 (severity levels). We converted 
   this to binary: 0 = no disease, 1+ = has disease

3. **Feature encoding**: 
   - Binary features like 'sex' ‚Üí 0=Female, 1=Male
   - Categorical features like chest pain type ‚Üí one-hot encoded

4. **Missing data**: Used median imputation for continuous variables, mode for categorical

5. **Outlier removal**: Applied Z-score threshold to remove extreme values

*[DEMO: Show the data cleaning code and before/after comparison]*

The result? Clean, standardized data ready for machine learning."

SLIDE 4: FEATURE ANALYSIS & KEY INSIGHTS
========================================
"""

print("""
üîç FEATURE ANALYSIS (60 seconds)
===============================

"One of the most interesting parts was discovering which health factors matter most.

*[SHOW: Feature importance chart]*

**Top 3 Predictors:**
1. **Cholesterol (15% importance)**: Values above 240 mg/dl significantly increase risk
2. **Maximum Heart Rate (14% importance)**: Lower max heart rate (<120) indicates higher risk
3. **Age (12% importance)**: Risk increases dramatically after age 60

**Clinical Insight**: This aligns perfectly with medical knowledge! Doctors have long known 
that cholesterol and cardiovascular fitness (measured by max heart rate) are key indicators.

*[SHOW: Correlation heatmap]*

What's fascinating is that our machine learning model automatically discovered these 
relationships from the data - no medical expertise required during training."

ü§ñ MODEL COMPARISON (90 seconds)
===============================

"We tested three different machine learning algorithms:

*[SHOW: Performance comparison chart]*

**Results:**
                 Accuracy  Precision  Recall   ROC-AUC
Logistic Reg.    79.9%     86.0%     78.9%    88.7%
Random Forest    84.2%     87.7%     85.3%    91.7%
Gradient Boost   85.9%     91.1%     84.4%    90.7%

**Why Gradient Boosting won:**
- Highest accuracy (85.9%) - correctly predicts 86 out of 100 cases
- Best precision (91.1%) - when it says 'disease', it's right 91% of the time
- Strong recall (84.4%) - catches 84% of actual disease cases

**Methodology:**
- 80/20 train-test split (stratified to maintain class balance)
- 5-fold cross-validation for reliable performance estimates
- StandardScaler applied after split to prevent data leakage

*[SHOW: ROC curves comparison]*

The ROC curve shows our model significantly outperforms random guessing (0.5 baseline)."

üåç REAL-WORLD IMPACT (60 seconds)
================================

"This isn't just an academic exercise - this system has genuine clinical potential:

**Immediate Applications:**
- **Primary Care Screening**: Doctors can get instant risk assessments during routine visits
- **Public Health**: Deploy in pharmacies, community centers for mass screening
- **Telemedicine**: Integrate into remote consultation platforms
- **Personal Health**: Individuals can monitor their risk over time

**Success Story Simulation:**
'Imagine: A 58-year-old visits a pharmacy for blood pressure screening. Their cholesterol 
comes back at 260, max heart rate is 115. Our system immediately flags HIGH RISK and 
recommends cardiology referral. Two weeks later, tests reveal 90% arterial blockage. 
Early intervention saves a life.'

**Scalability**: 
- Current: Handles individual predictions in milliseconds
- Future: Batch processing for hospital systems
- Goal: Make heart disease screening as routine as checking blood pressure

The key insight: Machine learning doesn't replace doctors - it amplifies their ability 
to catch problems early."

**Final Thought**: 
Heart disease kills 1 person every 34 seconds in the US. If this system helps catch even 
one case early, it's been worth every line of code.

SLIDE 12: Q&A PREPARATION
========================
"""

print("""
‚ùì COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
============================

**Q: How do you handle patient privacy?**
A: Currently this is a demo with anonymized data. For production, we'd implement HIPAA-compliant 
   encryption, secure data transmission, and audit logging.

**Q: What if the model makes a wrong prediction?**
A: Our system provides probability scores, not definitive diagnoses. It's designed to flag 
   potential risk for further medical evaluation, not replace professional diagnosis.

**Q: Why only 85.9% accuracy? Isn't that risky for healthcare?**
A: 85.9% is excellent for medical prediction. For comparison, mammography screening has 
   similar accuracy rates. The key is using this as a screening tool, not diagnostic tool.

**Q: How did you validate the clinical relevance?**
A: Our top features (cholesterol, max heart rate) align with established medical knowledge. 
   Feature importance analysis confirmed the model learned medically meaningful patterns.

**Q: Could this work with other diseases?**
A: Absolutely! The same methodology could apply to diabetes, stroke risk, cancer screening - 
   any condition with measurable risk factors.

**Q: What makes this better than existing tools?**
A: Accessibility and speed. Current risk calculators require manual computation. Our system 
   provides instant, accurate assessments with clear explanations.
